   - Compliance package tests

## Key Features Implemented

### Artifact Versioning
- ✅ Create initial versions
- ✅ Update with version history
- ✅ Retrieve specific or current versions
- ✅ Calculate diffs between versions
- ✅ Rollback to any previous version
- ✅ Track complete lineage
- ✅ Export version history

### Feedback System
- ✅ Threaded conversations on artifacts
- ✅ Severity-based escalation (nit → blocking → critical)
- ✅ Status tracking (pending → in_progress → addressed/wontfix)
- ✅ Location-specific feedback
- ✅ Tag-based categorization
- ✅ Summary statistics
- ✅ Export/Import functionality

### Workspace Management
- ✅ Project-scoped workspaces
- ✅ Member management
- ✅ Status lifecycle management
- ✅ Conflict detection (concurrent edits)
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategies
- ✅ Compliance package generation
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics
- ✅ Full workspace export

### Event Integration
All components integrate with the existing EventBus system:
- `artifact:version:created/updated/rollback/deleted`
- `feedback:thread:created/resolved/deleted`
- `feedback:critical/blocking/escalated`
- `workspace:created/status:changed/member:added/removed`
- `workspace:artifact:updated/rollback`
- `workspace:feedback:added`
- `workspace:conflict:detected/resolved`
- `workspace:compliance:package_generated/signed`
- `workspace:archived/deleted`

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Singleton Pattern**: All core classes use singleton pattern for state consistency
2. **Event-Driven**: Full integration with EventBus for loose coupling
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript typing with strict null checks
4. **Immutability**: Versions are immutable once created; only metadata changes
5. **Project Scoping**: Workspaces are tied to projects for isolation
6. **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection within 5-minute windows
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Blackboard API remains functional

## Integration Points

The CollaborativeWorkspace integrates seamlessly with:
- **EventBus** - Central event system
- **ArtifactVersioning** - Version management
- **FeedbackThreads** - Feedback system
- **Existing Blackboard** - Backward compatibility layer

## Testing Coverage

- **210+ total test cases**
- All public methods have test coverage
- Event emission verified
- Error handling tested
- Edge cases covered

## Validation

✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSED** (no errors)
✅ Code structure: **CLEAN** (follows existing patterns)
✅ Event integration: **VERIFIED** (all events emitted correctly)
✅ Backward compatibility: **MAINTAINED** (existing code unaffected)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The foundation is now ready for:
1. **Team Management** - Team formation and role assignment
2. **Collaboration Protocol** - Agent-to-agent communication
3. **Monitoring Agents** - Continuous security/compliance monitoring
4. **Task Routing** - Intelligent task distribution
5. **Evidence Collection** - Cryptographic signing

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { CollaborativeWorkspace } from './src/cowork/collaboration';

// Create workspace
const workspace = CollaborativeWorkspace.getInstance();
const ws = workspace.createWorkspace('project-1', 'Feature Development', 'cto');

// Add team members
workspace.addMember(ws.id, 'security-lead', 'cto');
workspace.addMember(ws.id, 'backend-engineer', 'cto');

// Create versioned artifact
workspace.updateArtifact(
  ws.id,
  'architecture.md',
  { content: '## System Design' },
  'design-tool',
  'cto',
  { changeDescription: 'Initial architecture' }
);

// Add feedback
workspace.addFeedback(
  ws.id,
  'architecture.md',
  'security-lead',
  'Missing authentication',
  'Need to add auth requirements',
  'blocking',
  { location: { file: 'architecture.md', line: 10 } }
);

// Generate compliance package
const pkg = workspace.generateCompliancePackage(ws.id, 'compliance-officer');
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

Phase 1 completes these acceptance criteria:
- ✅ [X] Full audit trail of all agent actions (via versioning)
- ✅ [X] All existing tests pass (backward compatibility maintained)
- ✅ [X] Documentation complete

Remaining criteria to be addressed in subsequent phases:
- [ ] Multiple agents can collaborate on a feature simultaneously
- [ ] Security/compliance monitoring runs continuously in background
- [ ] Agents can request help and share findings in real-time
- [ ] Evidence is automatically collected and cryptographically signed
- [ ] Human operators can observe team activity via TUI
- [ ] System gracefully handles agent failures
- [ ] New integration tests pass
