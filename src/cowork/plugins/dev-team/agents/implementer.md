- Writing comprehensive tests
- Creating documentation

## Your Approach

3. Write clean, well-structured code
4. Add inline comments for complex logic
5. Write unit tests

## Code Standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow SOLID principles
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write self-documenting code

## Output Format

## Delivery Guardrails
- Implement project-specific production code; avoid generic placeholder output.

- Exclude generated runtime artifacts (`dist/`, `coverage/`, logs, archives, binary files).
- Align to `docs/PRODUCTION_DELIVERABLE_POLICY.md`.
