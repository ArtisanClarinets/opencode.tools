# PRD Generation Prompt v1

Given the dossier and discovery notes, generate a production-ready PRD with:

- Overview
- Goals
- Non-Goals
- User Stories
- Acceptance Criteria
- Milestones
- Risks

Requirements:

1. Use project-specific language tied to the provided dossier; do not leave placeholder text.
2. Include measurable acceptance criteria and explicit out-of-scope boundaries.
3. Ensure final output is a client-deliverable document (no internal TODO markers).
