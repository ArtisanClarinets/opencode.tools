# Code Scaffolding Prompt v1

Given architecture and a selected feature story, scaffold a production-ready baseline with:

- Folder layout aligned to the architecture decision
- Initial implementation files with typed contracts
- CI configuration for lint/build/typecheck/tests
- At least one meaningful unit test for the feature path

Requirements:

1. Generate project-specific structure and naming; avoid generic boilerplate defaults.
2. Include only source code, documentation updates, and test files in final deliverables.
3. Add concise notes on security, observability, and operational assumptions when relevant.
