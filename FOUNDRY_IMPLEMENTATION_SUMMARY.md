## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize the state machine
const machine = new EnterpriseStateMachine({
  definition: enterpriseWorkflow,
  context: projectContext
});

// Transition between states
await machine.dispatch("INIT_PROJECT");
await machine.dispatch("COMPLETE_TASK");

// Check available transitions
const available = machine.getAvailableTransitions();

// Initialize RBAC
const rbac = new RBACManager();
initializeEnterpriseRoles(rbac);

// Check permissions
const result = rbac.checkPermission(identity, {
  resource: "phase",
  action: "approve",
  scope: "project"
});

// Run security scan
const orchestrator = new SecurityDomainOrchestrator(
  machine, auditTrail, scanners, gateEvaluator
);
const evidence = await orchestrator.runSecurityScan("sast", "./src");

// Evaluate gate
const gateResult = await orchestrator.evaluateSecurityGate("sast_gate", [evidence]);
```
