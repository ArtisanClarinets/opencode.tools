# Phases 8 & 9 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Foundry Domain Orchestrators (Phase 8) and Foundry-Cowork Integration Bridge (Phase 9).

## Files Created

### Phase 8: Domain Orchestrators

#### Security Domain (`src/foundry/domains/security/`)
- `security-orchestrator.ts` - Security domain orchestrator with:
  - Threat modeling via SECURITY_LEAD agent
  - Continuous security monitoring with ParallelStateMonitor
  - SAST and secrets scanning
  - Auto-remediation for low-risk issues
  - Critical finding escalation to team
  - Security gate evaluation
  - Security posture tracking

#### Feature Domain (`src/foundry/domains/feature/`)
- `feature-orchestrator.ts` - Feature development orchestrator with:
  - Feature planning and spec management
  - Task routing to engineers based on capabilities
  - Peer review coordination
  - Validation gates (unit tests, integration tests, code quality, security)
  - Remediation workflow handling
  - Feature status tracking

#### Release Domain (`src/foundry/domains/release/`)
- `release-orchestrator.ts` - Release management orchestrator with:
  - Release preparation and artifact validation
  - Quality, security, and compliance gates
  - Deployment execution coordination
  - Automatic rollback handling
  - Post-deployment health monitoring
  - Approval workflows

### Phase 9: Integration Bridge

#### Team Adapter (`src/foundry/integration/`)
- `team-adapter.ts` - Bridge between Foundry roles and Cowork:
  - Maps Foundry roles to Cowork agents
  - Creates teams from Foundry role configurations
  - Resolves role permissions (canExecute, canVeto, approvalGates)
  - Supports custom role registration

#### Collaboration Bridge
- `collaboration-bridge.ts` - Deep Foundry-Cowork integration:
  - Team-based execution model
  - Parallel monitoring integration
  - Automatic evidence collection
  - Real-time TUI visibility via EventBus
  - Graceful agent failure handling
  - Health monitoring

### Index Files
All modules include proper `index.ts` files for clean exports.

### Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/foundry/`:
- `domains/security-orchestrator.test.ts`
- `domains/feature-orchestrator.test.ts`
- `domains/release-orchestrator.test.ts`
- `integration/team-adapter.test.ts`
- `integration/collaboration-bridge.test.ts`

## Key Features

1. **Team-Based Execution**: Replaces sequential role execution with collaborative team workflows
2. **Parallel Monitoring**: Continuous security/compliance monitoring runs alongside main workflow
3. **Evidence Collection**: Automatic evidence collection from all agent actions
4. **Real-Time Visibility**: EventBus integration provides live updates to TUI
5. **Graceful Failure Handling**: Agent failures are escalated to team leads
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Original sequential mode still works

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components:
- Uses existing `TeamManager` for team formation
- Uses existing `CollaborationProtocol` for agent communication
- Uses existing `ParallelStateMonitor` for monitoring
- Uses existing `EvidenceCollector` for evidence
- Uses existing `EventBus` for real-time updates
- Uses existing `FoundryOrchestrator` as base

### New Exports:
All components are exported from:
- `src/foundry/domains/index.ts`
- `src/foundry/integration/index.ts`

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FoundryOrchestrator } from './src/foundry/orchestrator';
import { FoundryCollaborationBridge } from './src/foundry/integration';

// Create bridge with collaborative mode enabled
const bridge = new FoundryCollaborationBridge();

// Execute with full team collaboration
const request = {
  projectId: 'proj-1',
  projectName: 'New Feature',
  repoRoot: '/path/to/repo',
  useCollaborativeMode: true
};

const context = await bridge.startProject(request);
// ... continues with team-based execution
```

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ Linting passes
✅ All imports resolved
✅ Type checking passes

## Next Steps
The implementation is ready for use. Teams can now:
1. Use domain-specific orchestrators for focused operations
2. Use the collaboration bridge for full team-based execution
3. Monitor real-time activity via TUI EventBus subscriptions
4. Collect evidence automatically for compliance
