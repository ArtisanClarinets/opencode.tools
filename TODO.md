# OpenCode Tools — Implementation Status & Production Readiness Assessment
==================================

## Executive Summary

The OpenCode Tools codebase has a solid architectural foundation with well-structured TypeScript code. The system is designed for seamless integration into the global OpenCode installation. However, significant gaps exist that block production deployment for Fortune-500 clients.

**Current Assessment**: ⚠️ **PROTOTYPE / MVP** - Core Research Agent is functional, other agents have varying levels of implementation.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Completed Components**

1. **Repository Structure** - 100% Complete
   - Clean, organized TypeScript monorepo structure.
   - All necessary configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, jest.config.js) optimized for global installation.

2. **Research Agent** - ✅ Production Ready
   - Enhanced with sophisticated scraping and normalization tools.
   - Real-time search, Zod validation, and persistence implemented.

### ⚠️ **Partially Implemented Components**

3. **Architecture Agent** - Basic Implementation
   - Generates Mermaid diagrams and structured development backlogs.
   - Some static/template-based output.

4. **CodeGen Agent** - Basic Implementation
   - Automated scaffolding for multiple tech stacks.
   - Limited file system integration.

5. **QA Agent** - Basic Implementation
   - Test plan generation and unit test scaffolding.
   - Static test plans (TestSprite integration optional).

6. **Delivery Agent** - Basic Implementation
   - Automated packaging and manifest generation.
   - Handoff procedures need enhancement.

## Seamless Global Integration

### Post-Installation Hook
- Running `npm install` now automatically triggers `scripts/post-install.ts`.
- This script registers bundled plugins in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`.
- Core MCP tools are configured for reliable global execution.

### MCP Tool Configuration
- **Core MCP Tools** (enabled): SequentialThinking, Memory, critical-thinking, DeepWiki-SSE
- **Optional MCP Tools** (disabled by default): Desktop-Commander, TestSprite, next-devtools, Serena, Prisma
- These optional tools can be enabled if installed separately.
- Command-line diagnostics tool provided: `npm run verify:mcp`.

---

## Security & Reliability

- **Secrets Management**: Basic redaction implemented; full secrets management pending.
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks with structured logging across all agents.
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent exponential backoff implemented for external tool calls.
- **Audit Trails**: Tool calls can be logged via audit.* MCP tools.

---

## Summary of Completion

- **Architecture**: Solid and scalable ✅
- **Agents**: Research Agent production-ready; others have basic implementations ⚠️
- **Integration**: Automatic and seamless ✅
- **Tests**: Most tests passing (see PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md for details) ⚠️

### Known Limitations

- **Security**: Authentication/authorization not implemented (Fortune-500 blocker)
- **Testing**: Some circular dependency issues in test suite
- **Documentation Agent**: Uses templates (not LLM-powered)
- **No LLM Integration**: Intelligence is hardcoded or template-based

**Next Steps**: Use `npm run tui` to access the integrated tools, or see PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md for detailed production readiness checklist.
