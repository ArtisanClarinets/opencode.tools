# Foundry Implementation Orchestrator

## Project: Complete Foundry Autonomous Development Team Implementation

### Objective
Implement a complete, corporate-level autonomous development team system (Aegis Foundry) that becomes the default method used by OpenCode Tools.

### Scope
1. Core Infrastructure (State Machine, Audit Trail, RBAC, Evidence)
2. Domain Orchestrators (Security, Feature, Release)
3. Security Scanner Integrations (Semgrep, Snyk, GitLeaks, Checkov, Trivy)
4. Compliance Automation (SOC2, GDPR)
5. Agent Integrations (Research, CodeGen, QA, Delivery adapters)
6. TUI Integration (Wire all views to real data)
7. Default Rollout (Make foundry the standard)

### Architecture Pattern
**Federated Multi-Agent Orchestration**
- Meta-Orchestrator coordinates Domain Orchestrators
- Clear compliance boundaries
- Immutable audit trail with hash chain
- Parallel state monitoring

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] State machine with parallel state support
- [ ] Immutable audit trail with cryptographic signing
- [ ] RBAC with condition-based permissions
- [ ] Extended agent registry (12 roles)
- [ ] Evidence manager with chain of custody

#### Phase 2: Security & Compliance (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Security scanner adapters
- [ ] SOC2 compliance automation
- [ ] Security gate definitions
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop workflows

#### Phase 3: Domain Orchestrators (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Security Domain Orchestrator
- [ ] Feature Domain Orchestrator
- [ ] Release Domain Orchestrator
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration

#### Phase 4: Integration & Rollout (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Agent adapters (Research, CodeGen, QA, Delivery)
- [ ] TUI data binding
- [ ] Default method integration
- [ ] Production hardening

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass linting
- All code must have >80% test coverage
- All types must pass TypeScript strict mode
- All builds must succeed
- All integrations must be tested

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run test:all` passes
- [ ] Foundry TUI loads with real data
- [ ] State machine executes full workflow
- [ ] Security gates block on vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit trail maintains integrity
- [ ] Default integration works

```

### Dependencies to Add
- ulid (for ID generation)
- Additional security scanners (optional)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for orchestrators
- E2E tests for full workflow
- Security tests for scanners
- Performance tests for audit trail
